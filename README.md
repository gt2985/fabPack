*Packaging Utility for Salesforce Professionals - Fabrice Cathala - 14 May 2016*

---

**fabPack** is a simple but efficient packaging utility that simplify moving meta-data packages in between Salesforce orgs. It's built around Salesforce's ANT migration toolkit that it enhances with a old-fashioned but efficient DOS GUI. 
fabPack is also ideal to build a packages library.

**fabPack** is based on the Force.com Migration Toolkit hence relies on the latest JDK to be installed properly to be able to call ANT's jar.

>**fabPack** saves time and reduces risk of manual mistakes. I'm recommending it to any Salesforce implementation teams dealing with lot of packaging work or willing to build a code library.
